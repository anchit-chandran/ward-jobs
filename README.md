A tracker for ward jobs.

# Description

One of the fun perks of being an F1 doctor in the NHS is completeing the barrage of jobs allocated for patients on your ward.

These range from the very mundane (request bloods) to the sort of mundane (liaise with other medical teams for advice). Helpfully, within these jobs, there will be one or two crucial items which can genuinely impact patient care.

Usually, these jobs are recorded on a random piece of paper, and lead to inefficiencies e.g.

- You are copying information e.g. patient name / hospital number; every item copied increases the risk of a copy error
- You must write repeat information e.g. multiple patients on the ward will require the same task such as daily bloods
- It's not always clear who's doing what task, and for multiple people to add / complete tasks
